# password-generator



Simple Password Generator
This is a straightforward Python script that generates a random password for you based on a length you provide.

How it Works
Imports random: It uses Python's built-in random module to make random choices.
Character Set: It defines a pool of characters that can be used in your password. This includes lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and common special symbols (!@#$%^&*).
Ask for Length: It prompts you to enter how long you want your password to be.
Builds Password: It then picks characters randomly from the defined pool, one by one, until the password reaches your desired length.
Prints Password: Finally, it displays the generated random password on your screen.
How to Use
Run the script: Simply execute the code cell.
Enter Desired Length: When it asks "Enter length:", type in a number (e.g., 12 for a 12-character password) and press Enter.
Get Your Password: The script will then print a strong, random password for you!
Example
If you run the script and enter 9 for the length, you might get something like this:

Enter length:9
1or2z^PJb
(The password will be different every time you run it!)
